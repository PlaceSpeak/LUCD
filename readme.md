# The Land Use Change Data standard

The **LUCD standard** (optionally pronounced "lucid") is a proposed open standard for publishing municipal data related to land use change. The initially anticipated use cases are re-zoning applications and development permits.

## What's here

**LUCD fields.txt**

This is a list of the required and optional fields for the LUCD standard. This schema is the core component of the standard. These fields can ultimately be published in a number of formats, including XML and JSON.

Required fields are marked with an asterisk. 

In cases where multiple instances of a data type can be present (e.g. a re-zoning affecting more than one street address or a development application that has been assigned more than one status during its assessment) square brackets are used to indicate where the fields for that data type can be repeated.
